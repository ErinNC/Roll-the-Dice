# Roll-the-Dice
 A Python-based dice rolling simulator script.

</br>


### About the App
This [text-based user interface (TUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) application runs a simulation of rolling up to six dice.  Each die is six-sided, and the values are produced using *random.randint()*. After each roll, an ASCII diagram will be generated to display the dice faces.

### Technologies
Built using Python 3.10.4 in VS Code 1.67.2

### Next Steps & More
- I intend to add a command-line interface in the future. Instructions available [here](https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/)
